						<p>
							For the American Lawyer I created a Sankey chart in Tableau that showed the flow of diversity into the types of lawyers and within law firms. The data was generated by a survey I sent out over a period of two months. The chart was fully interactive with the user having the ability to add up 160 of the largest 200 law firms in the country.

							<img src="./static/img/corp_score.png" alt="Corporate Scorecard">
						</a>
						<p>
							For Corporate Counsel's online magazine I created an infographic that displayed the top law firms under categories such as buyouts, various types of debt, and equities. The data was culled from various outside vendors. A ranking chart was created as well to showcase how firms moved from 2013 - 2014.

				 		</a>
					 	<p>
					 		This dashboard was used to track the Econonomic Confidence Index. Rather than send the client a new powerpoint every three months with the updated numbers, I created a Tableau Server graph that only the client had access to. Every three months I would update the numbers. This was also helpful as the client could access the report at anypoint and on any device.

					 	</a>

					 	<p>
					 		This was a proposed dashboard as an add-on a larger report on the statiscs of a Law Firm's Mid-level Associates. In conjecture with an overview of the survey, this tool would allow a law firm to pull statistics at a moment's whim. It was also helpful on our end as we could generate one report and then automatically generate each custom report at the press of a button. This project was well received by the Chief Technology Officer but sadly it has been not pushed into field. It is still under consideration.
